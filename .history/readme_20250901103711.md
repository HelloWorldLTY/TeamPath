## Accessing weights

## Training

Please refer our folder with names **rl_train** and **sft** for more details. We implement the framework with modified [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and [Llama-factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/tree/main). However, we also support [trl](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/tree/main) and the codes will be provided upon request.

## Tutorials

We have provided several demo notebooks, which can be found in folder **clean_tutorial**
