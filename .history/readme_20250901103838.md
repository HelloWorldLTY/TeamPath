# CoPath 🤝
This is the official code repo for the paper: CoPath: Building MultiModal Pathology Experts with Reasoning AI Copilots.

## Installation

The most important thing is to install verl. 


To install Llama factory for supervised fine-tuning, please refer

We also upload a conda yml file to reproduce our environment used for this project. We recommend users deploying this project in High Performance Computing centers. In personal computer, its installation time should be less than 10 minutes if you do not consider flash attention.

## Accessing weights

## Training

Please refer our folder with names **rl_train** and **sft** for more details. We implement the framework with modified [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and [Llama-factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/tree/main). However, we also support [trl](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/tree/main) and the codes will be provided upon request.

## Tutorials

We have provided several demo notebooks, which can be found in folder **clean_tutorial**
